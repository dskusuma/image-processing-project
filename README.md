2. Grayscale function
3. Move image
4. Zoom In and Zoom Out
5. Rotation
6. Brightness
7. Brightness (product and divide)
8. Warping
9. Histogram
10. Convolution
11. Smoothing(median, mean, modus)
12. Image Sharpening
13. Edge Detection
14. Threshold Segmentation
15. Region Growth Segmentation
16. Erotion
17. Dilation
18. Rotation with unique angle

and every functions must be included and executed with GUI.
